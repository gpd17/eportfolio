<p>My name is Gabby Dunlap, and I am an ICT major at Florida State Univeristy. I love working out and eating healthy. I have created this webpage to share my passion about being healthy and fit and to also show some of my work from this semester in ENC 2135.  </p>
<h2>Course Reflection</h2>
<p>After reading through all of my drafts on the Strong Research Paper page and Toned Rhetorical Analysis page, I definitely saw a growth in my writing. I have developed as a writer in many ways. In each of my rough drafts, I noticed that I was very repetitive with my writing. Often times, I would write the same idea just in a different way not knowing it still made my paper sound repetitive. In my papers, I typically had one central topic and would write off of that which is good, but that’s what made my paper sound repetitive. So, in my final drafts, I still stuck to the one central topic, but instead of just writing on that one topic, I made subtopics off the one central topic and wrote on that. </p>

<p>This semester in ENC 2135 I was definitely challenged in my writing. Both papers were challenging for me to write for different reasons. The research paper was challenging for me to write because of the amount and type of research I had to do for the paper. In the past when I would write papers, I would just google a question, click on that link if it sounded good, and use that link as a source, but for this paper that did not work. For one, I used an academic database to find sources, and I had to learn how to properly search for sources on that database. Although I used an academic database to find most of my sources, I still used google a little, but even then I had to learn how to properly learn how to find good credible sources on google, and that was challenging. My rhetorical analysis paper was challenging for me because it was easy to make the paper repetitive. As I discussed earlier, I learned how to fix this, but it was still challenging. </p>

<p>One of my favorite aspects of this semester in ENC 2135 were classroom discussions. Typically classroom discussions include the teacher talking to the students and awkwardly waiting for the students to respond and participate in the discussion, but in this class I love how we (the students) lead the discussion for many reasons. For one, it made it more comfortable for me to participate in the discussion because it was peer to peer. Furthermore, the discussions were not boring because everyone was actively participating. I also liked when people disagreed with each other because it made the discussion more interesting, and I was able to see other people’s point of view. I also liked how QQC posts were due the night before the discussion because it made it easier to lead the discussion. It made it easier that the QQC blog posts were due the night before because they turned into more of a outline/guide for the discussion. Also, I liked how our QQC post went along with the paper we were writing at the time. It helped me know what to do and what not do when writing. </p>
